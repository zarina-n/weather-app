## Summary
This project I built while studying advanced JavaScript

This weather widget whows the weather by your geolocation or by search

### How to use
Press "in your city button" to know weather in your location or put in a desired city name and press "in any city" button to know the weather in the city you are interested in

### What I learned and used to create this app:
* XML HttpRequest
* Interacting with the DOM
* The navigator object of JavaScript
* An OpenWeather API service
